# Summarize

I'm writing an essay arguing that the myth of return, as exemplified in the Odyssey, is universally relevant because it fulfills the universal human need for life to prevail over death.

The following are my notes for one of the sections in Markdown format. Please help me by summarizing them in one or two sentences, keeping in mind how they relate to the thesis.

# Make unique

I'm writing an essay arguing that the myth of return, as exemplified in the Odyssey, is universally relevant because it fulfills the universal human need for life to prevail over death.

The following message contains the sections I plan to include in my essay, along with their summaries, in Markdown format. However, the summaries overlap slightly in scope. Please cut each sectionâ€™s summary so that only the part unique to that section remains. Do not add anything new.

# Restructure

The following are some of my notes. Please re-organize them into coherent text I can use as a section of an essay. Only re-use my words, do not add any content. Keep citations in brackets, like so (Frame, 98-100). Do not structure your response as an entire essay - I will use it as part of a whole.
